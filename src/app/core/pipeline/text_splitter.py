test = split_text("It was a key. An ordinary key. I found it when I was getting your books ready for Goodwill. It was taped to the inside of the back cover of one of your music notebooks and looked like one of those thin, metal keys found on luggage. We never locked our luggage when we traveled. I wanted to, but you insisted it would never deter anyone. You used to laugh and say it would do just the opposite. That if you were a luggage handler at the airport, you would “accidentally” break all the locks you came across, just to see what was so precious inside. You also worried we would lose the keys. I wanted to remind you that I never lost anything, but I didn’t argue with you. I never liked arguing with you." \
"" \
"" \
"What could this key possibly unlock? We had joint accounts, joint trusts, joint everything. I had been managing our lives entirely. The practical, boring stuff. Oh, I didn’t mind. You brought so much beauty to my life, to so many other people’s lives. I thought it was funny to be your stay-at-home husband. And I was proud. So proud. How many times I sat in the front row watching you conduct your own music, swiveling my head all around to make sure everyone saw me and that everyone knew you were mine. Your hands would dance in the air, and your wild mane would quiver every time you jumped to the music. Such passion." \
"" \
"" \
"You stopped using batons because like everything else, you kept losing them. I thought your ability to lose things was endearing. You didn’t need a baton. You were mesmerizing to watch without any implements. I could watch you like that forever and never tire. Your Requiem, that was the last piece you conducted, right before the bad fall. If you remembered, you would think it was fitting for that to be your last. Just like Mozart, your favorite composer. And just as good too. Could serve as the end of the Requiem Mozart never finished." \
"" \
"Towards the end, oh, the end, you used to lie in bed eyes closed, and when you couldn’t move your hands anymore, your eyes would move under the lids, and I knew. I knew you were conducting. How I wished I could hear what you were hearing. I could never hum a tune, never see a movie in my mind. You always thought it was so fascinating, my aphantasia. I didn’t think there was anything interesting about it at all. What a pair we made: a man who lived in his mind and a man unable to picture anything there." \
"" \
"" \
"We didn’t have any secrets from each other. At least I didn’t have any from you. Why would you want to lock something away and not tell me about it? I didn’t want to believe anything sinister; I trusted you completely. Even though you had all those groupies and I knew that tuba player was in love with you. How his face would melt when you climbed up on the podium and raised your hands." \
"" \
"You were the looker of the two of us: tall, broad-shouldered, olive-skinned. You had the most intense eyes I had ever seen. I couldn’t believe you were interested in me. When I asked you what you saw in average-ole me, you said kindness and pure honesty. You said you were starved for these, and I felt so sorry for you. Sorry that you hadn’t experienced such basics. In my vows to you, I promised never to lie to you and never to be unkind. And you said you were mine and mine alone for the duration. And I believed you. I never worried. What could you possibly need to hide from me with a key?" \
"" \
"" \
"I searched the house and didn’t find anything locked. I searched both of your workrooms, first the one with the heavy oak table where you would start each of your compositions before transferring it to the computer in the recording room. I found other notebooks, just like this one. Yet none of them had a hidden key. And there was nothing locked anywhere I looked. I began to think there was nothing for me to find. But after you were gone, there was nothing else for me to do. I didn’t know what I hoped to find. I had already cleaned the house multiple times top to bottom and organized and reorganized everything that could be given away. I needed to do something else. I began to think I would never find a lock for that key although I was so grateful for your leaving me this mystery. It kept me occupied for weeks, and that was good." \

"I found it when I had stopped looking. I was flying to Reykjavik to visit my sister for the holidays, and I went to the basement to find my favorite neon-green suitcase. Rummaging through our metal rack of traveling bags, so many, too many, I came across one I had never seen before. It was a small black chalice case. Didn’t look like a suitcase at all. Looked more like a small safe. It was locked. My heart beat wildly as I ran upstairs for the key. I must have stood there in front of the locked case for a good five minutes, thinking all kinds of things I never thought before. I considered not opening it just to respect your privacy and from fear of what secret I might uncover. After all, this was something you never told me about. It was clearly something you didn’t want me to find." \
"" \
"" \
"And then curiosity got the better of me. I made a promise to love you no matter what I found. The key slid into the lock, and I turned it once, unlocking the case. Trembling with emotion, I lifted the lid. There, on a padded bed, fastened by a tight band so it would remain secure, was a gold baton, the first present I gave you those many, many years ago. And I wept." \

"Rummaging through the vinyl tote, Rose pushed aside the baby bottles and cloth diapers before finding the manila folder near the bottom. She froze when an open diaper pin bit into her palm. Unwilling to wake Sophie, she pressed the sting to her mouth until it passed. Learning her lesson, she went back in for the folder, this time more gingerly. " \
"" \
"" \
"She laid the unfinished dissertation proposal across her lap. It had been three days since her disastrous session with Dr. Balis, and she was still woefully behind. She had thought about canceling Sophie’s six-month checkup, but decided against it, so here she was in the waiting room, beneath the needlepoint wall hangings, rocking the stroller with one foot every time Sophie stirred." \
"" \
"" \
"Rose touched the pen to the margin of her proposal, but wrote nothing. The conversation with Dr. Balis kept diverting her from the sentence she had been trying to revise. She wished she had said more than “Lucky me” when he suggested that another husband might solve her problems. Her ex-husbands were her problem. But oh, well. Better retorts always came to her hours later, sometimes days, fully formed and utterly useless." \
"" \
"" \
"Two more days before the proposal was due, and Rose she was getting nowhere. She had nothing more to say about the new campaign finance laws. Disclosures, loopholes, reforms. Nothing. She closed the folder and returned it to the bag. Out of boredom, she perused the stack of magazines on the table beside her. Life. National Geographic. Ms. Magazine. Ultimately, she decided on the Business Week dated last November. Flipping through the pages, she scanned for anything remotely related to government policy. An article titled, “The Global Economy Enters a Rougher Decade” looked promising. She had finished two-thirds of the page when her palms began to glisten." \

"A week ago a friend invited a couple of other couples over for dinner. Eventually, the food (but not the wine) was cleared off the table for what turned out to be some fierce Scrabbling. Heeding the strategy of going for the shorter, more valuable word over the longer cheaper word, our final play was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–happens to be a Japanese Buddhist festival, and not, as I had originally asserted while laying the tiles on the board, one half of a chocolate-covered cherry treat. Anyway, the strategy worked. My team only lost by 53 points instead of 58." \

"Just the day before, our host had written of the challenges of writing short. In journalism–my friend’s chosen trade, and mostly my own, too–Mark Twain’s observation undoubtedly applies: “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.” The principle holds across genres, in letters, reporting, and other writing. It’s harder to be concise than to blather. (Full disclosure, this blog post will clock in at a blather-esque 803 words.) Good writing is boiled down, not baked full of air like a souffl??. No matter how yummy souffl??s may be. Which they are. Yummy like a Grisham novel." \
"" \
"Lately, I’ve been noticing how my sentences have a tendency to keep going when I write them onscreen. This goes for concentrated writing as well as correspondence. (Twain probably believed that correspondence, in an ideal world, also demands concentration. But he never used email.) Last week I caught myself packing four conjunctions into a three-line sentence in an email. That’s inexcusable. Since then, I have tried to eschew conjunctions whenever possible. Gone are the commas, the and’s, but’s, and so’s; in are staccato declaratives. Better to read like bad Hemingway than bad Faulkner.")
